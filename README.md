Clickjacker
===========

This tool emulates the i>clicker update server and injects an extra, user-
specified payload into legitimate updates. Run the main script,
`clickjacker.py`, with the `-h` flag for usage documentation.

*NOTE*: Currently only the Linux payload option will inject the payload in
a silent wayâ€”that is, in a way where the clicker software will continue to
function as normal. The Windows and macOS options currently replace the
software binary entirely.
